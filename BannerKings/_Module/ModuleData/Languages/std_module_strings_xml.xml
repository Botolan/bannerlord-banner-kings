Settlemetns have many new interconnected factors such as Mercantilism, Militarism, Stability, Autonomy, and others, making settlement management way more intricate than choosing a new town project every few weeks or so. They also have several new policies (multi choice options) and decisions (true/false options) that it's owner may manage. You can check all this information in Demesne Management tab in your settlements - all of the fields have tooltips with further explanations." />

These new skills provide new ways to acquire experience and level up. On top of that, skill modifiers are changed. For starters, the minimum experience gain is now 5% rather than 0%. This means that the vanilla game would block you from learning skills past a certain past - this is not the case anymore. You can always keep learning, albeit very slowly." />

    <string id="aYOjUrZBb" text="Game Balance - Soft Limits" />
    <string id="1zOCJ1spY" text="Among the many new stats tracking heroes and settlements are the Demesne Limit and Vassal Limit features. These act as soft limits respectively for fief ownership and vassal clans / knights under you. The limits set the point of diminishing returns. Going over it too much will eventually lead to negative returns. Effectively, Demesne Limit makes you incapable to hold an indeterminate amount of fiefs - you will only be able to efficiently manage a few - while vassal limit makes oversized kingdoms increasingly unviable to manage. The vanilla game sets no limit to how much land or people you control - those limits severely restrict these abilities." />

    <string id="hOdyZJFyN" text="Game Balance - AI Finances &amp; War" />
    <string id="NB5k0yBcy" text="In Banner Kings, AI lords now have much more dynamic financial lives. AI clans will buy caravans and workshops in similar manner to player. The same costs, incomes and restrictions apply.\nOver time, this means AI clans will build several sources of income, allowing them to grow bigger and stronger, or have reserves then losing their settlements.\nAnother major change is that AI will now save money during peace time. Lords will roam the world with small parties - enough to not get consistently captured by bandits - saving their reserves for war time. As a consequence of that, settlements train their volunteers - when war time comes, armies will be immediatly drafted and made mostly of quality troops instead of recruits.\nLastly, notables will now financially aid the clans they are supporters of. This creates a flow of currency from notables to lords, making them a more active part of wartimes." />

    <string id="S4ENuXwGK" text="Food is extensively reworked. Food in settlemetns is now produced and consumed in the hundreds by the day - every single person in the population eats, in a similar rate to your soldiers. Food in settlements is now dictated by settlement acreage and it's workforce. The settlement needs acres ready to work and people - serfs and slaves - to work on them. Settlements will no longer starve with markets full of food - the population will buy off the market stocks when production does not meed demand, meaning true starvating will only start when markets are completely out of food. Food stocks are much higher, based on population. Excess food in stocks will rot. If the limit is reached, the population sells food items to the market instead of the food simply disappearing. Food can be manually dumped into the settlement by stocking the Stack with food - it will only be consumed when the normal reserves are very low." />

    <string id="oqFjn04xO" text="In Banner Kings, the economy landscape is quite different.\nDemand is generated by population in settlements, and therefore much more dynamic than before as population classes fluctuate, and each class has different demands.\nTrade goods have modifiers such as 'fine', 'masterwork' or 'crude', what opens new possibilities in terms of profit.\nManufactured items are on average quite more expensive, making workshops and caravans significantly more profitable.\nWorkshops owners now pay taxes to the settlement owner.\nSettlement market gold no longer resets on a daily basis - settlements can accumulate large amounts of gold, or go bankrupt, hence need some time to recover." />

For example, agricultural productions are limited by the amount of acres available and their production capacity - even if you have extra workers, the fields can only produce so much.\nAs a result, villages can produce much more income than before. This is extra relevant for Knighthood, which you can read more about in the articles below." />

    <string id="sjYjM0vWv" text="In Banner Kings, legal titles exist in what is called Demesne (domain) Hierarchy. Titles may be landed or not. Landed titles are directly attached to a fief - lordships are village titles, baronies are castle titles, counties are town titles. Above these are unlanded titles, such as dukedoms and kingdoms. The hierarchy stablishes suzerain-vassal relationships between the title holders. Holding a title has several impacts, mainly affecting your Vassal Limit and Demesne Limit, that limit your number of vassal clans &amp; knights, and your limit of fiefs, respectively. Every faction at game start has a kingdom-level title that represents them. This title is passed on to successive leaders of the faction, in different forms, depending on the title's Succession law." />

All titles have Succession, Inheritance, Government and Gender laws. Succession describes how the faction leadership is inherited, while Inheritance describes the clans' leadership inheritance. Government has various passive effects on settlements as well as dictate what kingdom policies are possible, and sometimes restricts the other laws. Gender law describes the preference for a certain gender in terms of granting knighthood, faction succession and clan inheritance." />

Say you have a dukedom title - in the hierarchy, the dukedom is under a kingdom. The kingdom title holder will be your suzerain, and you their vassal. Vassals fulfill Duties such as paying taxes, or participating in armies (the player is coerced to participate, with renown penalties).

Once knighted, they can raise a party. It also requires a lordship title, who the knight will receive and use it's income to pay their own party - you only pay for those led by your family members. Knights can eventualy grow as lords and found their own clan. Knights are used by the AI, meaning many new lords are travelling on the map, and eventually many new clans sprout.

Asera is that which all followers of his Code seek to live up to; though most followers will accept that the words of Asera are transcribed to benefit the bloodlines which followed him.

Iovis, the Sky-Father reigns as the henotheistic patriarch who traditionally dwells upon Mount Erithrys.

The songs are often written in such a way that one may make known their beliefs and views on the subject by means of intonation; whilst the tomes depicting the tales are renown for their strange marginalia which often descend into comic flourishes where lesser scriveners depict their favored and reviled characters as strange creatures or grotesque beasts." />

Subtlety is seldom found, and parables and morality plays are all too commonly twisted to back the ideology of the teller.

Faqir, akhund, imams, and mushid make up the various levels of clergy who preach the Code and seek to apply its nuanced legalisms and rites to the Southlands.

Do not rob them of their wealth, even if the Sultan demands it - you must be charitable, you are their sibling." />
    <string id="uaDJjtPda" text="…And in weakness, do not allow others to usurp your station. Rebellion, sedition, betrayal - anathema to the Code of Asera. Brother shall not strike against brother, least of all by a knife in the back or by rousing a mob with vicious words or common strife. Suffer not rebellion, for to allow it to foment in the first place speaks to the immensity of your failings. All the pointless bloodshed which may come from such will tarnish you eternal, such that you may find yourself denied Heaven - condemned to an agony of your own making." />
    <string id="srfjBWJ4W" text="Be mindful also of the company you keep, for though all among the Aserai are as brothers - and even the Jawwal and Bedouin are as our cousins; those beyond our blood lineage may not understand your purpose.

    <string id="AAL5i4LqX" text="To not seek vengeance against those who have attacked your holdings, besieged your homes, murdered your people - is a greater shame. No doctrine of peace can outweigh the Code of Asera in this regard. Many such debts need to be paid, and it is horrifying that our rulers so often choose to forget this. The serpent which bites you and slithers away does not leave you in peace; only when the serpent is crushed, maimed, unable to bite you again does it depart in peace." />

Though outsiders are wont to confuse the Amra Ollamh as little more than tales of goblins, sprites, fair folk and woodland monsters - the creed itself is in fact a deeply involved cultural institution meant to instill the youth of Battania with the lessons of their forebears by way of colloquial metaphor. The Brithem, law-speakers and judges, more than often related to the headmen of their village, maintain traditions whilst the women of the Bandrui preach these tales to children with the hopes of driving them to boldness and hopeful ambitions later on in life. Cattle raiding, braggadocious dueling bouts, and no small amount of criminal activity paired with lessons of mercy make up much of what is learnt by those who follow the Amra Ollamh. Those seeking greater insight into the spiritual matters of the Battanians are more likely to be dissuaded by Brithem lawspeakers, so as not to intrude upon the more esoteric matters handled by the practitioners of the Derwyddon arts." />

It was during this period that doctrines and reforms attributed to the teenage Emperor Darusos, a figure infamously denied the rite of the divus by the generals who usurped him, were uncovered. Viewed as a divine Martyr, rebels and lesser cults throughout the Empire began to preach his teachings and claim that the divinity of the imperial line was inherent; that the rite of the divus was a formality at best or a means of vaunting false emperors to positions of divine power. Now worshiped throughout the Southern Empire and in hidden cells of far flung holdings, the Darusosian Martyrdom preach the divine mandate that enshrines the rulership of the line of Arenicos. Lay flamines, their purer superiors of the Flamines Castus, and the figurehead of the Rex Sacrarum of Lycaron, collect alms and absolve the sins of petty mortal ambition to those who seek to walk the path of the Martyr." />
    <string id="S3PK8xHmj" text="I’ve no qualms over many a mortal failing, but if you are to bind thine self to the throne of the Martyr and seek to untwist your soul of sin - you must serve none save for another Darusosian Martyr. Be it Rhagaea Pethros, the Divine Heir Ira Pethros; or any other who may yet emerge immaculate - you must serve only the ends of our Empire. Seek not to burden thyself with a hoard of filthy lucre, for denars shall twist thine soul to marred, mangled ends." />
    <string id="6x6MRsExZ" text="Be not one who acts unbenignantly, for we servants within the Darusosian Martyrdom need be graceful in our deeds. Do not sully your house with cohorts or spouses who were born of upstart states or pagan cultures who deny the will of the Martyr." />
    <string id="KxOdw1TtY" text="Only a blind man would look upon the state of the Empire and think it saved. If you wish to remain in the good graces of the Darusosian Martyrdom, you should not seek to usurp the whims of the imperial throne. Should you be blessed to serve the house of Pethros, allow them to grant you territories - never make demands of them. If you fail to provide donations and services to our clergy, this too shall be noticed and your reputation shall fall." />
    <string id="8PkoTfYGn" text="Give generously to the Martyrdom, for to do otherwise is to see patrician and plebeian alike suffer unjustly.

    <string id="F65qMZXBn" text="Do not allow our enemies to remain comfortable in their belligerent stagnancy. Be as a scourge to the Embers of the Flame, but take not the heads of their heresiarch masters - they must learn penance upon the path to re-entering the Martyr’s good graces." />

    <string id="iP922jtfg" text="Oh, thou’rt of a kind to think they may posture before the Rex Sacrarum? Set thine eyes upon my personage with a coy and feigned humility? For what foul purpose doth thou think this shall profit them? To come before me so discourteously, as if I were some mere member of the lay flamines meant to play scenes of betrayal like some fool goliard of the upstart borderland principalities? Glory be to Darusos, for he was not spared or given mercy from unclean company which sought beyond their station and it seems now that I am to be tested in the same unkind way." />

Or rather, they would drive you to shameful sorrow or to mock a Martyr - dead by savage hands.I would not do you such an unkindness.Pray, forgive me.

    <string id="6BwUR5vhw" text="Mine is the voice that speaks for the Martyr’s will, alas only in mournful penitentials. I wear this mantle by my own volition, for overlong have there been aspiring tyrants who sought to further usurp his mandates by way of vile machinations. Seldom am I to preach, for mine is the role to contemplate the mysteries of creation as glanced by Darusos as he was made eternal through the rites of divus.Fret not, for though I hold all the myriad gods of our Empire - both those liberated from savage cultures and those brought with us from our ancestral birthplace - I am that which holds the Martyr above all others." />
    <string id="HxoVJnjX0" text="I preach the doctrines of Darusos, our Emperor betrayed in his youth by the vile treachery of his generals. A child, wise beyond his years and graced with the beatific sight of Heaven; he sought to see the Empire reign as a place of order where patrician and plebeian alike need not suffer fear. He would see us fed, watered, and granted the joys that we are due - and if not for the craven workings of sellswords and tyrant upstarts, he would have reigned one thousand years." />
    <string id="Pg0kS6rQr" text="Lo, for I preach the tragedy of the Martyr Darusos, an Emperor betrayed in his youth by the cruel ambitions of his generals. He was targeted, for even the most oathbound man can be made a craven sellsword when they gaze upon the throne of an Empire. Darusos was a goodly sort, he wept for the Palaics and the Vakken, he wrote an elegy for the Perassic League in their fading days. He saw the Empire as united in soul and in spirit, undone from within only by the actions of wicked men. It was for this that Darusos was crucified upon a sacred fig tree and set ablaze - all his aspirations but kindling… Take heart, for this is the sermon of a Martyr - not merely one of a man." />
    <string id="qZrqetWso" text="‘Tis my desire to spread the denied transpositions of the Martyr to the licentious masses of our age. To absolve our Empire the foul stains of hubristic usurpers, and to see seized with thine own hands a fate where the line betwixt Darusos to Arenicos, and beyond to Rhagaea Pethros and Ira Pethros may undergo the rite of divus before tragedy may befall them. I preach that the god - emperors of old who claimed deified rank, clutched at such power only through the long gaze of history.By candlelight mine eyes have gleaned that such heights are not unattainable, that within the mysteries and doctrine of Darusos, sits the illustrious path to Heaven that man may tread without departing the mortal coil." />
    <string id="6XLHsGxqR" text="But no. Betrayed by his generals, spat upon by the Senate, and mocked by his honor guard - Darusos was crucified to a sacred fig tree and burnt to cinders. His great works and scribed doctrines set ablaze with him. As one of the Flamines Castus, I seek to purify those who have walked a path of sin and shame.For the Martyr knows that the failings of those who betrayed them were born from human frailty -they feared change, and in their fear enacted change as fearsome as any other.None of us are immaculate, but there are some who may become pure and unsullied such as I.Pray then, that you may become like me." />
    <string id="hRs5n6aiA" text="The imperial line was enshrined upon the throne by a hand most divine during its origins, and thus though Darusos was murdered by militants - his words could not be silenced. Though upstarts like Lucon Osticos and Garios Comnos would seek to usurp the mandate of heaven, consider that the late Emperor Arenicos Pethros was a man-made-divine who was Martyred in a similar fashion. It is only through Empress Rhagaea Pethros and the heir Ira Pethros - that this holy line continues. History should not repeat itself further.No more heroes of our Empire need die for the vanity of lesser men or savage nationals.Darusos awaits us in heaven, and paradise is awarded to those who seek to better the lives of his citizens, and enact the reforms he was denied in life." />
    <string id="f1nmVPyND" text="Ahh, ‘tis wisdom and arrogance that thou shalt seek the Rex Sacrarum for elucidation. What is thine intent, to seek one wise beyond the ken of an age and bid they preach the rote doctrine of the lay flamines? Thoust have no need to be coy, nor ignorant, nor false. I shall speak and do so with courtesy - for this is what the Martyr would have of me. Perilous is the hour and heretics run rife through our Empire.Scourge those who cling to the Augeo Sophica or the Parens Patriae, shame their leaders; see them seized by brutish hands befitting brutish miens such as theirs.Let not their disarray see our fiefs fall to the avaricious hearts of lesser, wayward men." />

Donate your wealth to the Martyrdom, free yourself from the burdens of silver and gold. Give food to the needy, see our soldiers fed so we may endure the long siege we suffer upon our ideals. Make yourself known and friend to others within the ranks of the Flamines Castus, gain an audience and supplicate yourself before the Rex Sacrarum. " />
