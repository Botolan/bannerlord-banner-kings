Settlemetns have many new interconnected factors such as Mercantilism, Militarism, Stability, Autonomy, and others, making settlement management way more intricate than choosing a new town project every few weeks or so. They also have several new policies (multi choice options) and decisions (true/false options) that it's owner may manage.

These new skills provide new ways to acquire experience and level up. On top of that, skill modifiers are changed. For starters, the minimum experience gain is now 5% rather than 0%. This means that the vanilla game would block you from learning skills past a certain past - this is not the case anymore. You can always keep learning, albeit very slowly." />

    <string id="POPHJYnE5" text="Game Balance - Soft Limits" />
    <string id="c7jusvkEX" text="Among the many new stats tracking heroes and settlements are the Demesne Limit and Vassal Limit features. These act as soft limits respectively for fief ownership and vassal clans / knights under you. The limits set the point of diminishing returns. Going over it too much will eventually lead to negative returns. Effectively, Demesne Limit makes you incapable to hold an indeterminate amount of fiefs - you will only be able to efficiently manage a few - while vassal limit makes oversized kingdoms increasingly unviable to manage. The vanilla game sets no limit to how much land or people you control - those limits severely restrict these abilities." />

    <string id="shubmrBJE" text="Game Balance - AI Finances &amp; War" />
    <string id="RZwnbJg9A" text="In Banner Kings, AI lords now have much more dynamic financial lives. AI clans will buy caravans and workshops in similar manner to player. The same costs, incomes and restrictions apply.\nOver time, this means AI clans will build several sources of income, allowing them to grow bigger and stronger, or have reserves then losing their settlements.\nAnother major change is that AI will now save money during peace time. Lords will roam the world with small parties - enough to not get consistently captured by bandits - saving their reserves for war time. As a consequence of that, settlements train their volunteers - when war time comes, armies will be immediatly drafted and made mostly of quality troops instead of recruits.\nLastly, notables will now financially aid the clans they are supporters of. This creates a flow of currency from notables to lords, making them a more active part of wartimes." />

    <string id="V0cpkYBer" text="Food is extensively reworked. Food in settlemetns is now produced and consumed in the hundreds by the day - every single person in the population eats, in a similar rate to your soldiers. Food in settlements is now dictated by settlement acreage and it's workforce. The settlement needs acres ready to work and people - serfs and slaves - to work on them. Settlements will no longer starve with markets full of food - the population will buy off the market stocks when production does not meed demand, meaning true starvating will only start when markets are completely out of food. Food stocks are much higher, based on population. Excess food in stocks will rot. If the limit is reached, the population sells food items to the market instead of the food simply disappearing. Food can be manually dumped into the settlement by stocking the Stack with food - it will only be consumed when the normal reserves are very low." />

For example, agricultural productions are limited by the amount of acres available and their production capacity - even if you have extra workers, the fields can only produce so much.\nAs a result, villages can produce much more income than before.

    <string id="NcQvQqNQp" text="In Banner Kings, legal titles exist in what is called Demesne (domain) Hierarchy. Titles may be landed or not. Landed titles are directly attached to a fief - lordships are village titles, baronies are castle titles, counties are town titles. Above these are unlanded titles, such as dukedoms and kingdoms. The hierarchy stablishes suzerain-vassal relationships between the title holders. Holding a title has several impacts, mainly affecting your Vassal Limit and Demesne Limit, that limit your number of vassal clans &amp; knights, and your limit of fiefs, respectively. Every faction at game start has a kingdom-level title that represents them. This title is passed on to successive leaders of the faction, in different forms, depending on the title's Succession law." />

All titles have Succession, Inheritance, Government and Gender laws. Succession describes how the faction leadership is inherited, while Inheritance describes the clans' leadership inheritance. Government has various passive effects on settlements as well as dictate what kingdom policies are possible, and sometimes restricts the other laws. Gender law describes the preference for a certain gender in terms of granting knighthood, faction succession and clan inheritance." />

Once knighted, they can raise a party. It also requires a lordship title, who the knight will receive and use it's income to pay their own party - you only pay for those led by your family members. Knights can eventualy grow as lords and found their own clan. Knights are used by the AI, meaning many new lords are travelling on the map, and eventually many new clans sprout.

Iovis, the Sky-Father reigns as the henotheistic patriarch who traditionally dwells upon Mount Erithrys.

The songs are often written in such a way that one may make known their beliefs and views on the subject by means of intonation; whilst the tomes depicting the tales are renown for their strange marginalia which often descend into comic flourishes where lesser scriveners depict their favored and reviled characters as strange creatures or grotesque beasts." />

Subtlety is seldom found, and parables and morality plays are all too commonly twisted to back the ideology of the teller. As such the works depicted therein are often viewed as satire or crude witticisms, but few cloisters will deny their worth.

All tribesmen of the Aserai who do not wander as bedouin, are assumed to be followers of the Code of Asera - though only those who seek to study the intricacies of the mythic patrilineal bloodline and its influence upon the world are celebrated and viewed as Sons of Asera; a facet of colloquial nomenclature meant to force camaraderie as all members of the Sultanate make claim to being descendants of Asera. Faqir, akhund, imams, and mushid make up the various levels of clergy who preach the Code and seek to apply its nuanced legalisms and rites to the Southlands. As a whole, those who follow the Code of Asera place an emphasis on charity between communities, vengeance against those who defy precedent or tradition, and mercy given in kindness with justice forced if kindness is scorned." />
    <string id="pBMPQt8aN" text="Do not be as a glutton or a beast; neither hoarding nor bloodlust should color your life. If you take justice into your hands you may find yourself forever grasping for more - allow your betters to guide you as an elder sibling should; do not kill prisoners who have wronged you without their say. But do not reveal yourself to be lax or limp of arm either; for justice will often be your task." />
    <string id="6407rfYnN" text="You must never betray the blood of your blood, to do so is to spit upon the Code. If you are called to serve the Aserai, you must shed blood for their cause - at least once, so as to show that you honor your siblings even should you disagree with their choices. You must ensure any who serve you do not suffer the ravages of conflict without justice on your lips and a safe bastion for them to find reprieve in." />
    <string id="O9vTmMvVX" text="…A curious question; though I suppose I would know the deeper answers to this. Few are the faqir or even imam who are as studied in the various things so easily lost in transcription or by cause of would-be sultans seeking to justify their cruelty. The Code does not abide warring between Sons, a facet easily lost and ignored but a point of shame that could tarnish many of our leaders." />
    <string id="TAP7M4Cfc" text="It is wise to ask this - we dwell in uncertain times. Greed and rage cloud the hearts of many. Do no harm to the other Sons of Asera; the villagers should never fear your blade in these lands. Do not rob them of their wealth, even if the Sultan demands it - you must be charitable, you are their sibling." />
    <string id="OYHs6iCeE" text="…And in weakness, do not allow others to usurp your station. Rebellion, sedition, betrayal - anathema to the Code of Asera. Brother shall not strike against brother, least of all by a knife in the back or by rousing a mob with vicious words or common strife. Suffer not rebellion, for to allow it to foment in the first place speaks to the immensity of your failings. All the pointless bloodshed which may come from such will tarnish you eternal, such that you may find yourself denied Heaven - condemned to an agony of your own making." />
    <string id="tpSoxoWag" text="Be mindful also of the company you keep, for though all among the Aserai are as brothers - and even the Jawwal and Bedouin are as our cousins; those beyond our blood lineage may not understand your purpose. They may lead you from the path, away from the Code; away from the good of the Aserai. But perhaps I speak this in fear - the long toll of the Empire upon our culture." />
    <string id="gEmOt15yQ" text="To not seek vengeance against those who have attacked your holdings, besieged your homes, murdered your people - is a greater shame. No doctrine of peace can outweigh the Code of Asera in this regard. Many such debts need to be paid, and it is horrifying that our rulers so often choose to forget this. The serpent which bites you and slithers away does not leave you in peace; only when the serpent is crushed, maimed, unable to bite you again does it depart in peace." />
    <string id="82KczcLBB" text="When you are called by your brothers, you must come to them; you must serve beside them, you must never fail them if it is in your power. Know also that keeping the company of those outside the Code of Asera will surely corrupt you - you are your brother’s keeper, and they in turn yours. For good or for ill." />
    <string id="yMSXsfG14" text="Know that I tolerate your presence on behalf of my blooded siblings in the Banu, and though you may desire to coax me with honeyed words or threats of coercion - know also that I am beyond your grasp. I am the Murshid of [Placename], and my word guides the Sultanate by the reading of the Code of Asera. Speak truthfully and with no deceit, lest I denounce your lineage and see them flayed to the last." />
    <string id="i9n3rmGdR" text="Peace be upon you, outlander. May you walk with the safety of Asera while you dwell in the company of his sons - and while you walk the lands where his Code is law. I am an Imam of the Aserai, and I bid you hospitality expecting it fully in kind. Is there something I may do for our mutual good?" />
    <string id="yLh0mgbWH" text="Peace be to you, outlander. You do not carry yourself as a Son of Asera, so I shall forgive your ignorance - provided you come here in search of wisdom. I am an Akhund, a scholar of the Code of Asera, the guiding truth of the southlands. If you come here with a clouded heart, there is little I can offer you." />
    <string id="TpMB0kYQE" text="Peace be to you, outlander. May you be welcomed in the lands of the Sons of Asera. May you enter here in kindness, but know that we do court the ignorant." />
    <string id="UEYiz8qzT" text="Blessings of paradise and the Heavens upon you, blooded sibling. You come before the Murshid of [Placename], a guide to the Sultanate and of kin to the Banu. Surely you know that I am a busy man who must contend with matters of state whilst consulting the Code of Asera. What is it that I may do for you while I have this single moment to offer?" />
    <string id="5fWfL7YLb" text="Mashaera, blood of my blood. It is good to see you are alive and that you are in good health; for the world is rife with conflict beyond our brotherhood and little is to be held as certain. Are you here on pilgrimage or duty, in good tidings or ill news? How may this humble Imam be of service to his sibling?" />
    <string id="SXOseCqhy" text="Peace be upon you, my kin. Have you come to study the Code of Asera? I shall grant you what wisdom I have gleaned in my long hours of study, but as your brother I must tell you that I find myself more ignorant the more I realize the breadth of what there is still yet to learn." />

    <string id="vnVchgm9y" text="Alas, you are no Son of Asera and thus you could never truly follow the Code of Asera. Not in any way that I could fathom. There may be precedent for one beyond our blood to successfully follow the code, but for this you should seek out an Akhund; a scholar of the faith." />
    <string id="V4JBOSb4K" text="You think that it would go unnoticed how the folk here cringe at your visage? How your name is whispered with scornful lips? Are they mislead about you? Perhaps, perhaps. We shall see." />
    <string id="ktUArntFN" text="You are known to me and to this village; not as a savior or as a good soul, but as one of us. You are humble, perhaps because you lack the boldness to pursue being charitable - or perhaps just the means. I do not know, and I do not judge." />
    <string id="AfAdxDuOK" text="Mashaera, blood of my blood. It is good to see you are alive and that you are in good health; for the world is rife with conflict beyond our brotherhood and little is to be held as certain.

    <string id="0ZHQnq4nU" text="Peace be upon you, my kin. Have you come to study the Code of Asera?

    <string id="UV2dV4rSu" text="I wish you well in such pursuits, and that you live a life of peace wherever this path may take you." />
    <string id="uyBvUhfmT" text="If you wish to be made a follower of the Code of Asera, you must treat these people as you would a sibling - you must cherish them, exalt them, protect them and educate them. Show them your better nature and I shall perform upon you our rites of induction." />
    <string id="d9nS1RfX2" text="I welcome you, my kin - blood of my blood. May you go in peace and bring honor to his legacy." />
    <string id="ZUWN5WxnU" text="" />
    <string id="cOgKitEwP" text="I offer my sage counsel to the kin of the Banu, to guide them upon the paths walked by Asera of old. I grant them the means of pilgrimage - for only when one knows the deepest wisdom and learned truths of the Code of Asera may they truly strive for self-improvement." />
    <string id="vvsV0LrSu" text="I preach the glory of Asera, our progenitor of legend. I preach lessons learned from the treasury of wisdom he has granted us as his children. I preach that the Aserai shall reign in happiness and in sorrow, so long as we remain as brothers within the Banu confederacies." />
    <string id="FbcYiA6ch" text="I preach that which is hidden in poetics of Nahasi dialects and in the riddles of converts stolen away by Darshi slavers in generations past. I seek to unravel the mysteries of all that Asera asked of his sons - to truly understand charity, devotion, and the cost of peace even in these times of eschatological turmoil." />
    <string id="jdsidxwTW" text="I preach the Code of Asera, the backbone of our society, the soul of our nation. For we are all Sons of Asera in these lands, and it is through the patriarch’s example that we go forth in honor and bring glory to his legacy." />
    <string id="XfvZaSoRS" text="I ensure they remember that they are as siblings to the lowliest beggar or the most jackal-thirsting Jawwal marauder; that they must always express love towards that which is good and revile the roguery that leads the soul towards wicked deeds." />
    <string id="x0wKBDJF6" text="I preach that our future shall be as luminous as the sun and as enduring as the Nahasa, so long as we remain united, so long as we are charitable, so long as we welcome even the Jawwal to embrace the Code as their own guiding path in life!" />
    <string id="WRSoqFssD" text="I preach that we should question the nature of goodness and of wisdom; for a good man would not claim to be wise, and a wise man not claim to be good." />
    <string id="g4ZnFC2zT" text="We are those who adhere to tradition but know also the struggle to move beyond the belligerence of the past - we are no Jawwal, after all." />
    <string id="zMQHFmTCu" text="You come before me, like a wriggling eel slithering to a master archer and asking to learn to wield the bow. I shall speak plainly to you, for my time is short and my station vaunted. When you see that which is evil, you must change it by whatever force you can - if not your hands, then your heart, if not your heart, then your words." />
    <string id="nMVjefZmO" text="A common question among the devout and misguided alike; for how can one truly be assured they walk the righteous path? We know not until the end comes and we are weighed against the deeds of our progenitor; but I shall guide you with what wisdom I can." />
    <string id="TwkhS6c8K" text="Consider your actions and why it is you perform them. If you are of influence, do you wield this power for the good of your siblings or do you take it for your own aggrandizement? When your people starve, do you feast? Do you turn to the sword? Is blood spilled for bread gained a worthy trade?" />
    <string id="uO7ayDxhW" text="It does my heart kindly to hear you wish to prove your faith. We live in an age of lip service by most - though I hold no blame to the common man for this; they show their adherence and their faith in their daily labors. If you wish to prove your faith and your adherence to doctrine, you must be a soul who knows peace and who adheres to hierarchy." />
    <string id="iHBMBX1dH" text="Seek to improve the lives of even the least of your people and you shall make kings of them all; and know that should you find yourself poorer and your servants richer that you are a better sibling than many of your blood. You can only hope then that they shall follow your example, follow the Code of Asera, and spread this prosperity to all." />
    <string id="9vHv4royt" text="Foremost in my viewing, as a man of the cities of our lands; is the act of almsgiving. We are as keepers to our brothers, to our sisters and siblings; and only a cruel soul would let the blood of their blood starve.You are only as pure as the lowest among us, and thus you purify yourself of sin when you seek to uplift the whole of the Aserai." />
    <string id="UK7X5U1Gc" text="If you seek to prove your faith, you must internalize the Code of Asera - you must learn and accept that you are but one of his Sons - and you must seek to bring forth a better world for your children to inherit. Prove your faith by making that world. Time will tell if the image in your mind is truly an embodiment of the Code’s doctrines or merely self-indulgence." />
    <string id="r0W9ytgS9" text="Release your prisoners if you no longer war with their masters; or give them to your master for they shall know better.

    <string id="qBXvmijpR" text="The creed of the Amra Ollamh, “that which is wondrous and great” - is the long-standing folkloric tradition of the people who dwell up the Uchalion plateau. Though outsiders are wont to confuse the Amra Ollamh as little more than tales of goblins, sprites, fair folk and woodland monsters - the creed itself is in fact a deeply involved cultural institution meant to instill the youth of Battania with the lessons of their forebears by way of colloquial metaphor. The Brithem, law-speakers and judges, more than often related to the headmen of their village, maintain traditions whilst the women of the Bandrui preach these tales to children with the hopes of driving them to boldness and hopeful ambitions later on in life. Cattle raiding, braggadocious dueling bouts, and no small amount of criminal activity paired with lessons of mercy make up much of what is learnt by those who follow the Amra Ollamh. Those seeking greater insight into the spiritual matters of the Battanians are more likely to be dissuaded by Brithem lawspeakers, so as not to intrude upon the more esoteric matters handled by the practitioners of the Derwyddon arts." />
    <string id="KWW0am20T" text="No respect shall ever come to those who bend the knee willingly, and least of all to the foreign upstarts who gnaw upon our holdings. Those who strike upon our wildling sons, wolfskin or otherwise, put our future in danger as a people." />

We are all one Battania, and if you see us sundered you best see us forged anew with haste. Otherwise you’d deserve a fate far fouler than what any draoith could conjure up. I’d personally suggest ye get slathered in honey, your limbs snapped, and thrown into a craggy pit to be feasted on by boars.But you wouldn’t be such a craven to tempt that fate, now would ye {NAME}?" />

If you come seeking satisfaction, you’re better off finding it in a Vlandian brothel or in some imperial parlor succoring down milk-of-the-poppy. My judgment is not meant to bring you anything you couldn’t take for yourself, and my law-speaking is for the Battanian people not whatever matter of wild hound you were born to be." />

Do you come to me in the hopes that I might slather a bride in mud so her wiles are not driven to hysteria by the invisible probings of the fair folk? Mayhaps you heard tales of the Brandui like myself and how we will put a gimlet eye on rivals for a price - oh aye, make their loins shrivel up like a gooseberry and produce only half-wit sons? You best speak your part quick, I’ve no time for the fool courting of foreign folk.You best watch your words too, there’s nary a man in this land who wouldn’t stab you in the gizzard to win my approval." />

But tis the wisest of men who speaks least and I’ve made myself the fool in your presence; good humor that. Truly your heart beats for Battania, a soul ever the envy of any mormaer or fian gone gallowglass or made to fight upon the highland fields. Blessed this is; a kindness this is." />

There’s a glint in the eye, something at the corner of your lips - you’ve got the capacity to act as a true Battanian should.

Mind me and grant me the courtesy of a moment in stunned silence, for not since the ancient rebel queens of the hill clans which warred with the Laconians and Dryatics before the damnable Calradoi came ashore; have I had the knowledge to know of one whose heart beats so true for Battania. Envious I am, for those who cannot do must surely teach and I know all too well that I shall carry your name ‘pon my lips for many a year to come.You’ve the guile of a rogue and the cadence of one who is worthy of legend.May the mormaer blush at your mention and the fian wish they were half the man you’re being denies by being." />

But to answer your question, and to say it right, I’ll say just this: I am that which judges a true Battanian of their worth.To see that they make mischief and might alike enough to please their grandfather’s grandfathers in the heavenly hereafter.Ne’er are there more an Uchalion born Battanian than those who follow the creed of the Amra Ollamh." />

I am that which guides a Battanian to know their truth.To see their heart beats in rhythm with the cycles of creation, that they know might and mischief enough to please the unseen and to court the joy of their ancestors long displaced.Ne’er are there more an Uchalion born Battanian than those who are guided by the Amra Ollamh." />

    <string id="LjwjBMO4D" text="Though the Calradic Empire had long possessed an imperial cult to venerate Emperors who were deemed to be “deliverers” and “saviors” of the civilized world, during the latter years prior to the schism and inerrenegrum the practice of viewing all emperors as god-emperors had become vulgorously commonplace. It was during this period that doctrines and reforms attributed to the teenage Emperor Darusos, a figure infamously denied the rite of the divus by the generals who usurped him, were uncovered. Viewed as a divine Martyr, rebels and lesser cults throughout the Empire began to preach his teachings and claim that the divinity of the imperial line was inherent; that the rite of the divus was a formality at best or a means of vaunting false emperors to positions of divine power. Now worshiped throughout the Southern Empire and in hidden cells of far flung holdings, the Darusosian Martyrdom preach the divine mandate that enshrines the rulership of the line of Arenicos. Lay flamines, their purer superiors of the Flamines Castus, and the figurehead of the Rex Sacrarum of Lycaron, collect alms and absolve the sins of petty mortal ambition to those who seek to walk the path of the Martyr." />
    <string id="aVOxytsKa" text="I’ve no qualms over many a mortal failing, but if you are to bind thine self to the throne of the Martyr and seek to untwist your soul of sin - you must serve none save for another Darusosian Martyr. Be it Rhagaea Pethros, the Divine Heir Ira Pethros; or any other who may yet emerge immaculate - you must serve only the ends of our Empire. Seek not to burden thyself with a hoard of filthy lucre, for denars shall twist thine soul to marred, mangled ends." />
    <string id="4sTQkTu6K" text="Be not one who acts unbenignantly, for we servants within the Darusosian Martyrdom need be graceful in our deeds. Do not sully your house with cohorts or spouses who were born of upstart states or pagan cultures who deny the will of the Martyr." />

If you wish to remain in the good graces of the Darusosian Martyrdom, you should not seek to usurp the whims of the imperial throne.

If you fail to provide donations and services to our clergy, this too shall be noticed and your reputation shall fall." />

I wear this mantle by my own volition, for overlong have there been aspiring tyrants who sought to further usurp his mandates by way of vile machinations. Seldom am I to preach, for mine is the role to contemplate the mysteries of creation as glanced by Darusos as he was made eternal through the rites of divus.Fret not, for though I hold all the myriad gods of our Empire - both those liberated from savage cultures and those brought with us from our ancestral birthplace - I am that which holds the Martyr above all others." />
    <string id="e3ZQKBqsU" text="I preach the doctrines of Darusos, our Emperor betrayed in his youth by the vile treachery of his generals. A child, wise beyond his years and graced with the beatific sight of Heaven; he sought to see the Empire reign as a place of order where patrician and plebeian alike need not suffer fear. He would see us fed, watered, and granted the joys that we are due - and if not for the craven workings of sellswords and tyrant upstarts, he would have reigned one thousand years." />
    <string id="2QYPJi1QK" text="Lo, for I preach the tragedy of the Martyr Darusos, an Emperor betrayed in his youth by the cruel ambitions of his generals. He was targeted, for even the most oathbound man can be made a craven sellsword when they gaze upon the throne of an Empire. Darusos was a goodly sort, he wept for the Palaics and the Vakken, he wrote an elegy for the Perassic League in their fading days. He saw the Empire as united in soul and in spirit, undone from within only by the actions of wicked men. It was for this that Darusos was crucified upon a sacred fig tree and set ablaze - all his aspirations but kindling… Take heart, for this is the sermon of a Martyr - not merely one of a man." />
    <string id="M1xknAi7X" text="‘Tis my desire to spread the denied transpositions of the Martyr to the licentious masses of our age. To absolve our Empire the foul stains of hubristic usurpers, and to see seized with thine own hands a fate where the line betwixt Darusos to Arenicos, and beyond to Rhagaea Pethros and Ira Pethros may undergo the rite of divus before tragedy may befall them. I preach that the god - emperors of old who claimed deified rank, clutched at such power only through the long gaze of history.By candlelight mine eyes have gleaned that such heights are not unattainable, that within the mysteries and doctrine of Darusos, sits the illustrious path to Heaven that man may tread without departing the mortal coil." />
    <string id="rxD9vK1iH" text="But no. Betrayed by his generals, spat upon by the Senate, and mocked by his honor guard - Darusos was crucified to a sacred fig tree and burnt to cinders. His great works and scribed doctrines set ablaze with him. As one of the Flamines Castus, I seek to purify those who have walked a path of sin and shame.For the Martyr knows that the failings of those who betrayed them were born from human frailty -they feared change, and in their fear enacted change as fearsome as any other.None of us are immaculate, but there are some who may become pure and unsullied such as I.Pray then, that you may become like me." />
    <string id="wzpkKQcyq" text="The imperial line was enshrined upon the throne by a hand most divine during its origins, and thus though Darusos was murdered by militants - his words could not be silenced. Though upstarts like Lucon Osticos and Garios Comnos would seek to usurp the mandate of heaven, consider that the late Emperor Arenicos Pethros was a man-made-divine who was Martyred in a similar fashion. It is only through Empress Rhagaea Pethros and the heir Ira Pethros - that this holy line continues. History should not repeat itself further.No more heroes of our Empire need die for the vanity of lesser men or savage nationals.Darusos awaits us in heaven, and paradise is awarded to those who seek to better the lives of his citizens, and enact the reforms he was denied in life." />
    <string id="XijFskspO" text="Ahh, ‘tis wisdom and arrogance that thou shalt seek the Rex Sacrarum for elucidation. What is thine intent, to seek one wise beyond the ken of an age and bid they preach the rote doctrine of the lay flamines? Thoust have no need to be coy, nor ignorant, nor false. I shall speak and do so with courtesy - for this is what the Martyr would have of me. Perilous is the hour and heretics run rife through our Empire.Scourge those who cling to the Augeo Sophica or the Parens Patriae, shame their leaders; see them seized by brutish hands befitting brutish miens such as theirs.Let not their disarray see our fiefs fall to the avaricious hearts of lesser, wayward men." />

While young goliards boast in the cities of our kingdom, I am but a scrivener and have resigned myself to a priory where I might best illuminate the tales of the land by my own hand." />
    <string id="vx0teKQDp" text="Preach? Do not think me some imperial dog quibbling over their penitential! I do not preach, I sing of the Canticles. I tell the tales of our ancestors and our contemporaries, of those worthy of song and those who carry the song ever upon their lips." />
    <string id="i7us77Fkg" text="I fought, I killed, I was a legend in the making - as all men would claim to be in hubris. But my hands ached upon a sword hilt; far more than when I gripped a quill. And thus I illuminate, even still in my sunset days." />
    <string id="rR4gTE1SP" text="It is a humble post, and those who recite the tales by rote are seldom worthy of the annals themselves - but those who pen them are granted the privilege of signing their names, and thus we shall be remembered as those who carried the song. " />
    <string id="saW9QXWJQ" text="Preach, bah! A Vlandian does not preach, they embody the epic and embolden themselves to actions - to pursuits grander than those who came before them!" />
    <string id="4scrOXPsH" text="In my youth I would tell you that to be sung of requires violence and glorious deeds; but wiser now I say you need only be patient. Our faith - if one can call it a faith beyond that which we put in our peers - is one of syncretism and patience. We speak of the Heavens, the Otherworld, the Sight, all manner of tenets absorbed from lands we’ve conquered and fought upon." />
    <string id="0tSWcD7hf" text="Prove your… Perhaps you do not understand the nature of the Canticles? You are a player upon this stage, a character within the tale; all who live are. Whether you are to be tertiary, secondary; villain or protagonist, is a matter of those who pen the page and the nature of your deeds. If you wish to be exalted by history and sung of in the Canticles, you must spread your influence far and wide." />
    <string id="YDNdynjZx" text="f you wish to be enshrined within the tales and songs of the Vlandian people, you must embody those who came before you and learn from their deeds. You must then prove your mettle and that you are not a mere follower upon the path, but a being worthy of being sung in the Canticles of the nation. Knights and kings, barons and bandits; all will fade with time if they do not give cause for their memory to be known." />
    <string id="QUmGfM88J" text="All things we accept as truth, though not of importance when compared to the legacy we leave upon this world. If you wish to prove your faith, go forth with an open mind and a patient heart; if you are to be a legend worthy of the Canticles, fate shall provide you the chance. " />
    <string id="j0vioz4Nt" text="You must be known, for good or for ill; by deeds worthy of remembrance. Vlandia celebrates warfare and the mercenary life for many reasons, but foremost among them for many is that a sellsword is far more memorable than a money lender or a basket weaver. If you wish to prove your place is more worthy of the song, perform bold deeds. " />
    <string id="bF7z3uHOU" text="If you wish to prove your mettle, you must compete with the deeds of old for the good of our people. Conquer, raid, play at court; make yourself known - live a life both bold and notorious! Better you have ten thousand enemies who remember your name than a single cherished friend whose memory of you will die with them." />
