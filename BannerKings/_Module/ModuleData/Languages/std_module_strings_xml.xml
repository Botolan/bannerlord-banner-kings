		<string id="nJ7opwQp" text="Settlement Management" />
		<string id="xh8DAQPd" text="In Banner Kings, settlement management is several layers more in depth than vanilla. Settlemetns have many new interconnected factors such as Mercantilism, Militarism, Stability, Autonomy, and others, making settlement management way more intricate than choosing a new town project every few weeks or so. They also have several new policies (multi choice options) and decisions (true/false options) that it's owner may manage. You can check all this information in Demesne Management tab in your settlements - all of the fields have tooltips with further explanations." />

		<string id="fbd1Es2n" text="Game Balance - Skills" />
		<string id="4QCu9XrG" text="Banner Kings introduces a new Attribute - Wisdom - as well as 3 new skills: Scholarship, Lordship and Theology. These new skills provide new ways to acquire experience and level up. On top of that, skill modifiers are changed. For starters, the minimum experience gain is now 5% rather than 0%. This means that the vanilla game would block you from learning skills past a certain past - this is not the case anymore. You can always keep learning, albeit very slowly." />
		<string id="22KVCc0V" text="Learn about the new skills and experience gainning changes." />
		<string id="NKvS1QaS" text="Game Balance - Soft Limits" />
		<string id="KeJNSYjF" text="Among the many new stats tracking heroes and settlements are the Demesne Limit and Vassal Limit features. These act as soft limits respectively for fief ownership and vassal clans / knights under you. The limits set the point of diminishing returns. Going over it too much will eventually lead to negative returns. Effectively, Demesne Limit makes you incapable to hold an indeterminate amount of fiefs - you will only be able to efficiently manage a few - while vassal limit makes oversized kingdoms increasingly unviable to manage. The vanilla game sets no limit to how much land or people you control - those limits severely restrict these abilities." />
		<string id="qVKvOfeO" text="Learn about the new soft limits that significantly prevent snowballing or overgrowing." />
		<string id="iTMpMoaC" text="Game Balance - AI Finances &amp; War" />
		<string id="kJp46kvo" text="In Banner Kings, AI lords now have much more dynamic financial lives. AI clans will buy caravans and workshops in similar manner to player. The same costs, incomes and restrictions apply.\nOver time, this means AI clans will build several sources of income, allowing them to grow bigger and stronger, or have reserves then losing their settlements.\nAnother major change is that AI will now save money during peace time. Lords will roam the world with small parties - enough to not get consistently captured by bandits - saving their reserves for war time. As a consequence of that, settlements train their volunteers - when war time comes, armies will be immediatly drafted and made mostly of quality troops instead of recruits.\nLastly, notables will now financially aid the clans they are supporters of. This creates a flow of currency from notables to lords, making them a more active part of wartimes." />
		<string id="zvkePdyd" text="Learn about the expansions to AI financial decisions that make the game more dynamic." />
		<string id="SEqsTFHr" text="Game Balance - Settlement Food" />
		<string id="phtiDwFf" text="Food is extensively reworked. Food in settlemetns is now produced and consumed in the hundreds by the day - every single person in the population eats, in a similar rate to your soldiers. Food in settlements is now dictated by settlement acreage and it's workforce. The settlement needs acres ready to work and people - serfs and slaves - to work on them. Settlements will no longer starve with markets full of food - the population will buy off the market stocks when production does not meed demand, meaning true starvating will only start when markets are completely out of food. Food stocks are much higher, based on population. Excess food in stocks will rot. If the limit is reached, the population sells food items to the market instead of the food simply disappearing. Food can be manually dumped into the settlement by stocking the Stack with food - it will only be consumed when the normal reserves are very low." />
		<string id="DGmKuqJF" text="Economy" />
		<string id="jf5c5A9F" text="In Banner Kings, the economy landscape is quite different.\nDemand is generated by population in settlements, and therefore much more dynamic than before as population classes fluctuate, and each class has different demands.\nTrade goods have modifiers such as 'fine', 'masterwork' or 'crude', what opens new possibilities in terms of profit.\nManufactured items are on average quite more expensive, making workshops and caravans significantly more profitable.\nWorkshops owners now pay taxes to the settlement owner.\nSettlement market gold no longer resets on a daily basis - settlements can accumulate large amounts of gold, or go bankrupt, hence need some time to recover." />
		<string id="etXH8tuf" text="Learn about the various improvements over the economy system." />
		<string id="B7QZ2NjD" text="Economy - Villages" />
		<string id="pEaH1pun" text="Villages produce income by selling their production outputs. Villages will now produce based on population workforce, as well as available acreage, if fitting. For example, agricultural productions are limited by the amount of acres available and their production capacity - even if you have extra workers, the fields can only produce so much.\nAs a result, villages can produce much more income than before. This is extra relevant for Knighthood, which you can read more about in the articles below." />

		<string id="XGJwauOX" text="Titles" />
		<string id="52x0j2Oz" text="In Banner Kings, legal titles exist in what is called Demesne (domain) Hierarchy. Titles may be landed or not. Landed titles are directly attached to a fief - lordships are village titles, baronies are castle titles, counties are town titles. Above these are unlanded titles, such as dukedoms and kingdoms. The hierarchy stablishes suzerain-vassal relationships between the title holders. Holding a title has several impacts, mainly affecting your Vassal Limit and Demesne Limit, that limit your number of vassal clans &amp; knights, and your limit of fiefs, respectively. Every faction at game start has a kingdom-level title that represents them. This title is passed on to successive leaders of the faction, in different forms, depending on the title's Succession law." />
		<string id="9vNYm6VW" text="Learn about the novel titles and their usages." />
		<string id="Mk2PHPor" text="Titles - Laws" />
		<string id="hFvvg7NL" text="Titles are also composed of laws, duties and rights, that together form the contract. All titles in the same hierarchy have the same contract. All titles have Succession, Inheritance, Government and Gender laws. Succession describes how the faction leadership is inherited, while Inheritance describes the clans' leadership inheritance. Government has various passive effects on settlements as well as dictate what kingdom policies are possible, and sometimes restricts the other laws. Gender law describes the preference for a certain gender in terms of granting knighthood, faction succession and clan inheritance." />

		<string id="wwkz28Qr" text="Titles are also composed of laws, duties and rights, that together form the contract. All titles in the same hierarchy have the same contract. Duties and Rights are fulfilled between vassal and suzerain. Your suzerain is the title holder of the title directly above your highest title. Say you have a dukedom title - in the hierarchy, the dukedom is under a kingdom. The kingdom title holder will be your suzerain, and you their vassal. Vassals fulfill Duties such as paying taxes, or participating in armies (the player is coerced to participate, with renown penalties). Suzerains fulfill rights such as granting titles or financial aids in certain circunstances." />

		<string id="hBC1FCdQ" text="Knighthood &amp; Dynamic Clans" />
		<string id="fM02395Z" text="In Banner Kings, companions are no longer able to raise clan parties. Instead, they can be knighted, a process that involves spending influence and denars. Once knighted, they can raise a party. It also requires a lordship title, who the knight will receive and use it's income to pay their own party - you only pay for those led by your family members. Knights can eventualy grow as lords and found their own clan. Knights are used by the AI, meaning many new lords are travelling on the map, and eventually many new clans sprout. The player may try to stop their own knights from creating clans." />

Such claims have led to kinstrife and civil war in the past, with daughters being viewed as a dead end to a pure line, and many a ‘lesser son’ made eunuch as means of societal control. In the modern age, the Ibn-Zakaa are far more enlightened, viewing themselves not as deserving of a divinely appointed respect but rather in the light of those who have much to prove to be worthy in the eyes of their progenitor." />

To be of the blood of Asera is to be bound to the morals of a mortal man made legendary, and thus matters of failure and mortal flaws must be treated with compassion. The most famous practitioner of the Rashuqqalih school was Queen Eshora, who brought several nomadic badw tribes into the Sultanate by accepting their adherence to tradition as a thing to be celebrated, rather than as a matter to consider them a distasteful other." />

Seldom petitioned, as they are viewed as capricious entities; the Slaugh Aos’An are said to visit Battania during the changing of the seasons and to witness the birth of those ordained by fate to bring about weal and doom to the land. To make an oath under the auspices of the Slaugh Aos’An is to be bound to the letter or the spirit of one’s words; never more and never both.

Though the attempted Calradification of the Uchalion Plateau could not purge this pagan belief set entirely, it did compartmentalize and mangle its body of rituals. Giants, ghosts, and many an unseen shade were changed from beings of tale and legend to “patient devils” by the whims of the Empire. In recent years, some have sought to venerate the Dymhna Sidset; viewing them instead as aspects of rebellion and irredentism." />

Emperors were deified, made to stand alongside their own gods as peers. During the waning generations of the united empire many would proclaim themselves god-emperor, or other divinely appointed titles; the rite of the divus can only transubstantiate an emperor upon their death. Thus the last truly ordained imperial cult is that which preaches the words of Arenicos Divus; though upstart branches have begun for an inevitable worship of Ira Divus." />

Within the Darusosian Martyrdom, the locally vaunted Lycaronian Triad is held above all other eternal divinities and viewed as adjacent to mortal emperors risen to divinity by the rites of the divus. Iovis, the Sky-Father reigns as the henotheistic patriarch who traditionally dwells upon Mount Erithrys. He is accompanied by Astaronia, his bride who represents that which must be protected by the machinations of imperial might; and by his daughter Mesnona who was born from the ego of Iovis and who grants insight to mortal petitioners." />

The songs are often written in such a way that one may make known their beliefs and views on the subject by means of intonation; whilst the tomes depicting the tales are renown for their strange marginalia which often descend into comic flourishes where lesser scriveners depict their favored and reviled characters as strange creatures or grotesque beasts." />

Though traditionalists will note the Cant is but a deviation of the illuminated manuscripts and oral tales of the pre-Calradic Vlandian culture, modern adherents claim the Cant to be the methodology of rebels, wanderers, rascals, and conquerors. Subtlety is seldom found, and parables and morality plays are all too commonly twisted to back the ideology of the teller. As such the works depicted therein are often viewed as satire or crude witticisms, but few cloisters will deny their worth.

		<string id="E5c5GUkO" text="Founded by the immediate sons of the legendary patriarch of the Southlands, the Code of Asera forms the basis of philosophy, art and law among the members of the confederated Aserai tribes. All tribesmen of the Aserai who do not wander as bedouin, are assumed to be followers of the Code of Asera - though only those who seek to study the intricacies of the mythic patrilineal bloodline and its influence upon the world are celebrated and viewed as Sons of Asera; a facet of colloquial nomenclature meant to force camaraderie as all members of the Sultanate make claim to being descendants of Asera. Faqir, akhund, imams, and mushid make up the various levels of clergy who preach the Code and seek to apply its nuanced legalisms and rites to the Southlands. As a whole, those who follow the Code of Asera place an emphasis on charity between communities, vengeance against those who defy precedent or tradition, and mercy given in kindness with justice forced if kindness is scorned." />
		<string id="A1kV9e5Z" text="Do not be as a glutton or a beast; neither hoarding nor bloodlust should color your life. If you take justice into your hands you may find yourself forever grasping for more - allow your betters to guide you as an elder sibling should; do not kill prisoners who have wronged you without their say. But do not reveal yourself to be lax or limp of arm either; for justice will often be your task." />
		<string id="fai3SYUx" text="You must never betray the blood of your blood, to do so is to spit upon the Code. If you are called to serve the Aserai, you must shed blood for their cause - at least once, so as to show that you honor your siblings even should you disagree with their choices. You must ensure any who serve you do not suffer the ravages of conflict without justice on your lips and a safe bastion for them to find reprieve in." />
		<string id="nHaVv5HR" text="…A curious question; though I suppose I would know the deeper answers to this. Few are the faqir or even imam who are as studied in the various things so easily lost in transcription or by cause of would-be sultans seeking to justify their cruelty. The Code does not abide warring between Sons, a facet easily lost and ignored but a point of shame that could tarnish many of our leaders." />
		<string id="eByqu1db" text="It is wise to ask this - we dwell in uncertain times. Greed and rage cloud the hearts of many. Do no harm to the other Sons of Asera; the villagers should never fear your blade in these lands.

		<string id="RW2jZt0Y" text="…And in weakness, do not allow others to usurp your station. Rebellion, sedition, betrayal - anathema to the Code of Asera. Brother shall not strike against brother, least of all by a knife in the back or by rousing a mob with vicious words or common strife. Suffer not rebellion, for to allow it to foment in the first place speaks to the immensity of your failings. All the pointless bloodshed which may come from such will tarnish you eternal, such that you may find yourself denied Heaven - condemned to an agony of your own making." />

No doctrine of peace can outweigh the Code of Asera in this regard. Many such debts need to be paid, and it is horrifying that our rulers so often choose to forget this. The serpent which bites you and slithers away does not leave you in peace; only when the serpent is crushed, maimed, unable to bite you again does it depart in peace." />

Though outsiders are wont to confuse the Amra Ollamh as little more than tales of goblins, sprites, fair folk and woodland monsters - the creed itself is in fact a deeply involved cultural institution meant to instill the youth of Battania with the lessons of their forebears by way of colloquial metaphor. The Brithem, law-speakers and judges, more than often related to the headmen of their village, maintain traditions whilst the women of the Bandrui preach these tales to children with the hopes of driving them to boldness and hopeful ambitions later on in life. Cattle raiding, braggadocious dueling bouts, and no small amount of criminal activity paired with lessons of mercy make up much of what is learnt by those who follow the Amra Ollamh. Those seeking greater insight into the spiritual matters of the Battanians are more likely to be dissuaded by Brithem lawspeakers, so as not to intrude upon the more esoteric matters handled by the practitioners of the Derwyddon arts." />

It was during this period that doctrines and reforms attributed to the teenage Emperor Darusos, a figure infamously denied the rite of the divus by the generals who usurped him, were uncovered. Viewed as a divine Martyr, rebels and lesser cults throughout the Empire began to preach his teachings and claim that the divinity of the imperial line was inherent; that the rite of the divus was a formality at best or a means of vaunting false emperors to positions of divine power. Now worshiped throughout the Southern Empire and in hidden cells of far flung holdings, the Darusosian Martyrdom preach the divine mandate that enshrines the rulership of the line of Arenicos.

He saw the Empire as united in soul and in spirit, undone from within only by the actions of wicked men.

I preach that the god - emperors of old who claimed deified rank, clutched at such power only through the long gaze of history.By candlelight mine eyes have gleaned that such heights are not unattainable, that within the mysteries and doctrine of Darusos, sits the illustrious path to Heaven that man may tread without departing the mortal coil." />

As one of the Flamines Castus, I seek to purify those who have walked a path of sin and shame.For the Martyr knows that the failings of those who betrayed them were born from human frailty -they feared change, and in their fear enacted change as fearsome as any other.None of us are immaculate, but there are some who may become pure and unsullied such as I.Pray then, that you may become like me." />
		<string id="MKp3k4Nm" text="The imperial line was enshrined upon the throne by a hand most divine during its origins, and thus though Darusos was murdered by militants - his words could not be silenced. Though upstarts like Lucon Osticos and Garios Comnos would seek to usurp the mandate of heaven, consider that the late Emperor Arenicos Pethros was a man-made-divine who was Martyred in a similar fashion. It is only through Empress Rhagaea Pethros and the heir Ira Pethros - that this holy line continues. History should not repeat itself further.No more heroes of our Empire need die for the vanity of lesser men or savage nationals.Darusos awaits us in heaven, and paradise is awarded to those who seek to better the lives of his citizens, and enact the reforms he was denied in life." />

Their workings dishonor the Martyr - and should you shackle their heresiarch, I would see them brought before me. So they might know their lowly place… Mine are matters of far higher importance, thou shalt not impress me.Court the patricians and the flamines; sully not mine hours with vainglorious pursuits." />

In truth you could do much by providing food to the garrisons of our imperial holdings, disposing of looters who prey upon the downtrodden, and diminishing the number of disreputable blackguards from the Embers of the Flame - who dare speak the Martyr’s name in vanity." />

Our time in this world is short indeed, and mine all the shorter by virtue - or perhaps malus - of my age. Did you come to greet an old master and learn the way of the Canticles? If so, I beg you find a goliard - my voice does not carry with gusto as theirs does, and my words may seem withered by comparison. " />
		<string id="LAr2UpYJ" text="Stranger if you were led to me for the services of a town scribe, know that I work only in vellum and that unless you have procured me wax tablets all your own, there is little scrivener can offer you in terms of an education. It is not my job nor responsibility to tend to the illiterate, for I pen the Canticles and lest you somehow be a notable beyond my knowing - I see no cause to enshrine your name in such sacred work." />
		<string id="8O3EqSs6" text="Hmm? Oh yes, greetings. I feel as though I know you, or perhaps if not you then the deeds of one much like you stranger. You bear an uncanny resemblance to one whose deeds have reached the likes of we humble scriveners. I cannot be certain if I have penned your name or face in silverpoint, but I would be pleased to make your acquaintance should you be that soul. It would be my sacred honor, stranger, to know you." />
		<string id="yg1zK8SV" text="Hark, thy nameless and forgotten soul! Come wit and make yourself known such that you might dwell in my mind and be more than but a dim candle among bon fires! Do you not look upon the world and think yourself a lesser than your neighbors? Sons and daughters - children even! The young and the old make themselves worthy of praise, and yet among them you remain unworthy of pen and purpose. Do you not wish to be remembered?" />
		<string id="tmnCVmgv" text="Ah yes, another soul upon the path towards eternity; seeking glory and remembrance within the Canticles. The years grow long, and yet I feel all the shorter for them. Time bends the elderly with the weight of their deeds. What do you wish to share with me, and why is it me that you seek over scriveners and goliards?" />
		<string id="uVnJB6bW" text="O soul, how goes your tale? Worthy of telling, or on the ascent to such I am sure. Hero or villain, king or killer, I welcome you. Let us speak openly and in full truth, and may we be judged for our words amongst the whole of the Canticles." />
		<string id="vz7LGH1V" text="Hail to this one, and may all know their tale! Their name is spoken of, it is whispered and it is sung on wagging tongues - by goliard and troubadour alike! But are they hero or are they villain? A knave, a rake, a blaggard or a savior mayhaps? The Canticles are not yet written in full, the song not yet ended - but does that haunt you or inspire you? How history will see you known?" />
		<string id="yTZ3CK2N" text="Rare have been the days in my life that royals and kingkillers, emperors and sultans would come to speak to me. It has happened before, my words offered little comfort. Powerful rulers seek always to control how they are viewed, how they will be remembered; and in pursuit of eternity they damn themselves by neglecting the present. Your deeds and influence are those which will be penned in our grand works as a culture; but I pray that you do not forget that you live only in this age." />
		<string id="tVJsBVxW" text="I have heard of you, even seen the proper pigments used by one who may have potential to be my successor. Their work venerates you, and yet you do not know their name as they know yours. As I know yours." />

		<string id="EeDVBHPk" text="I am made elevated by your presence, for yours is a name sung upon many a verse within the Canticles. The young novices have ground many a gall nut to properly pen your deeds, and though I have seen your face in silverpoint before I know now how to better see it illuminated." />
		<string id="vRPCMntj" text="O soul, know that I have heard your name already and recognize you by your mien. It is a kindness in the Canticles, to have one’s reputation precede them. Your name is penned in my volumes where appropriate and important." />
		<string id="caaqxuUa" text="I applaud your desire, but you are not unique in this tale. Not yet. You are one of countless many who look upon their place in history and fear being forgotten. You could turn back now, take love and heart in a liminal existence. But should you desire to be known and to be sung of, you must first prove yourself worthy of my ink." />
		<string id="Bkc8xfrP" text="Do you think me the fool, o hero? I know well your name, and you are known well to the people. That you think you need be inducted to be part of our tales is both insult and strange courtesy; for you are an important player upon our world’s stage. But if you deign to think you need my approval than so be it. I shall see your name illuminated upon fine vellum, and when word of your deeds reaches the ears of others upon the path, I shall see it penned." />
		<string id="XhzhGhMk" text="I know your tale, there is value in hearing it but perhaps not yet in speaking it. Take no offense, you are worth more to the people than the escapades of a fishwife of Merroc or the rumors of a downtrodden swamp thug upon the Ebor. I shall pen your name within the tales of this age, a bit player for the moment - but such tertiary cast have a way of finding favoritism with those who seek to place themselves in the shoes of one they can imagine.fight." />
		<string id="Gi7uFuKE" text="Would you now? Bold of you to ask, bolder still to think you have the stones for it. You are an untested soul, your saga perhaps barely begun or as of yet unworthy of an audience. You are far from a Wilund the Bold or an Oca the Conqueror. I will not anoint you upon this path until you have a name worthy of a scrivener’s pen." />
		<string id="av2PJPFV" text="That you, someday, shall age and wither as I have. Your grave will come to claim you, as it claims us all. I prithee, live your life so that you inspire the best in those who come after you. Let your legacy be one worth following in heart, not pursued by iron and bloodshed." />
		<string id="KoTapRxP" text="Have you considered that perhaps when our hands and songs can convey only the small glimpses of the liminal upon vellum, that what is forgotten in the faith of the eternal is more beautiful? That it may yet rest, in Heavens or places fouler? That your name, should it rise ever higher, may be cursed or spoken for as long as our texts yet live? What glory you seek in this life may not follow you to the next. But very well, you are anointed upon our pages. May this bring you peace and allow you time to seek comforts more deeply personal." />
		<string id="kAppyLd5" text="I will remember your name for we have shared these words, but I fade with the hours from my autumn into winter; and what comfort you may hold by being known to an Elder Illuminator is a small thing to cherish when compared to being sung in a bard’s song." />
		<string id="PzjOwkUS" text="That you think you need the approval of a humble scrivener to be formally inducted into the Canticles is a courtesy unnecessary but greatly appreciated; for now my own name shall play a role beyond merely a rubricator in the grand tales of this age. " />

		<string id="4gMVyArd" text="I do not preach, I merely illuminate. I have penned the Canticles since I first arrived on the continent as a child, a war orphan in the homeland who found comfort only in the cold embrace of a cloister. I was a goliard, a true firebrand once; and a scrivener when time demanded it of me." />
		<string id="4tdEbON6" text="I do not preach, stranger. I pen the Canticles, the compounded histories of our myriad people - of our wars, our epics, our tragedies and our sorrows. While young goliards boast in the cities of our kingdom, I am but a scrivener and have resigned myself to a priory where I might best illuminate the tales of the land by my own hand." />
		<string id="HTurbxdm" text="Preach? Do not think me some imperial dog quibbling over their penitential! I do not preach, I sing of the Canticles. I tell the tales of our ancestors and our contemporaries, of those worthy of song and those who carry the song ever upon their lips." />
		<string id="4xKNwpH9" text="I fought, I killed, I was a legend in the making - as all men would claim to be in hubris. But my hands ached upon a sword hilt; far more than when I gripped a quill. And thus I illuminate, even still in my sunset days." />
		<string id="G9MiT6aS" text="It is a humble post, and those who recite the tales by rote are seldom worthy of the annals themselves - but those who pen them are granted the privilege of signing their names, and thus we shall be remembered as those who carried the song. " />
		<string id="QgZ6XeJE" text="Preach, bah! A Vlandian does not preach, they embody the epic and embolden themselves to actions - to pursuits grander than those who came before them!" />
		<string id="yCKZB4sG" text="In my youth I would tell you that to be sung of requires violence and glorious deeds; but wiser now I say you need only be patient. Our faith - if one can call it a faith beyond that which we put in our peers - is one of syncretism and patience. We speak of the Heavens, the Otherworld, the Sight, all manner of tenets absorbed from lands we’ve conquered and fought upon." />
		<string id="DkaA0drP" text="Prove your… Perhaps you do not understand the nature of the Canticles? You are a player upon this stage, a character within the tale; all who live are. Whether you are to be tertiary, secondary; villain or protagonist, is a matter of those who pen the page and the nature of your deeds. If you wish to be exalted by history and sung of in the Canticles, you must spread your influence far and wide." />
		<string id="md8bCpnL" text="f you wish to be enshrined within the tales and songs of the Vlandian people, you must embody those who came before you and learn from their deeds. You must then prove your mettle and that you are not a mere follower upon the path, but a being worthy of being sung in the Canticles of the nation. Knights and kings, barons and bandits; all will fade with time if they do not give cause for their memory to be known." />
		<string id="2ca4YgOZ" text="All things we accept as truth, though not of importance when compared to the legacy we leave upon this world. If you wish to prove your faith, go forth with an open mind and a patient heart; if you are to be a legend worthy of the Canticles, fate shall provide you the chance. " />
		<string id="pEYufs8M" text="You must be known, for good or for ill; by deeds worthy of remembrance. Vlandia celebrates warfare and the mercenary life for many reasons, but foremost among them for many is that a sellsword is far more memorable than a money lender or a basket weaver. If you wish to prove your place is more worthy of the song, perform bold deeds. " />
		<string id="SEetfZbx" text="If you wish to prove your mettle, you must compete with the deeds of old for the good of our people. Conquer, raid, play at court; make yourself known - live a life both bold and notorious!
